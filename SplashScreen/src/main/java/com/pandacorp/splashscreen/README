This is a module that contains files from `androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.0.1`.
The module contains several code modifications, such as:
1. Removing the following lines to resolve the issue on android 12+ when the statusBar and navigationBar colors
can't be set from themes.xml
```
    (activity.window.decorView as ViewGroup).setOnHierarchyChangeListener(hierarchyListener)
```
2. Added the following lines to the file `v31\styles` to remove the unwanted actionbar:
```
     <item name="android:windowActionBar">false</item>
     <item name="android:windowNoTitle">true</item>
```
